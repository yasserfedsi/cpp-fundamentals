# 📘 My C++ Learning Journey

This repository is a record of my journey learning **C++**, following resources like [roadmap.sh](https://roadmap.sh/cpp) and other references. It will include code examples, notes, and mini-projects as I progress.

---

## 🚀 Goals

- Learn the **basics of C++** (syntax, variables, operators, control flow).
- Master **functions, arrays, pointers, and references**.
- Explore **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** (classes, inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation).
- Understand **STL (Standard Template Library)**.
- Build **small projects** to apply what I’ve learned.
- Prepare for **problem-solving** and competitive programming.

---

## 📂 Structure

- `basics/` → Introductory concepts (hello world, variables, loops, conditionals).
- `control-flow/` → if-else, switch, goto, loops.
- `functions/` → Functions, recursion, parameter passing.
- `oop/` → Classes, objects, constructors, inheritance, polymorphism.
- `stl/` → Vectors, maps, sets, algorithms.
- `projects/` → Mini projects to practice.

## ✨ Notes

This journey is about **building a strong foundation** in C++ and applying it to real-world problems. I will update this README as I continue learning!
